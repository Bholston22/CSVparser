# CSVparser
Create a csv file representing your transcript at Shepherd. You may create it in Excel. The grades don't have to be your actual grades but the courses should be the ones you took. Think about how to represent different years and semesters, different subjects and courses, and different grades. Write a Python program that parses the csv file, computes the overall GPA, and displays a well-formatted transcript on screen. Exchange csv files with another student and generate their transcript as well. The two of you need to agree on a common csv format.
